# Border Color

The `border` utility contains classes that set the [CSS `border-color`][1]
property. This is the recommended way to set border color since they
automatically change based on the current theme.

Note that this only set the color. To have a border, you also need to set a
width, e.g. using the "border" class from Tailwind. You don't need to set the
border style since it's already default to "solid" in our [CSS reset][2].

```ts
import { border } from "@moai/core";

// The "border" class comes from Tailwind to set the border width
<div className={[border.weak, "border"].join(" ")}>Text</div>;
```

There are 2 colors in the `border` utility at the moment:

<ColorBorder rows={[{ key: "weak" }, { key: "strong" }]} />
