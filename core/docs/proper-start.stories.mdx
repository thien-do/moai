# Proper Start

If you are in a hurry, see the [Quick Start] instead. This page covers the same
steps but with more explanation and tips.

[Quick Start]: /?path=/docs/quick-start--page.

## 1. Install

The [@moai/core] package is the basis of the Moai kit. It provides all basic
components, from buttons to dialogs and tables, along with necessary CSS.
Install it with your package manager:

```
yarn add @moai/core
```

- It has [react] and [react-dom] as peer dependencies, so make sure they are
installed. (Which is usually the case if you use a framework like [Next.js] or
[CRA].)
- Moai is written entirely in TypeScript (strict mode!) so all typings are
bundled in the packages.

## 2. Setup

There are a few things you need to do **once** before using Moai's components:

### 2.1. Styling

Import Moai's CSS bundle at your app root. This contains CSS for all components
in the "core" package.

```tsx
import "@moai/core/dist/bundle.css";
```

- In Next.js, use the [custom App]. In CRA, use `src/index`.
- The bundled CSS contains a [simple reset], so it's best to not include
another one.
- All CSS for components use [CSS Modules]. This means all class names are
scoped so you can use other class-based libraries like [Tailwind CSS] or
[Tachyons] without worrying about naming conflict.

[Tachyons]: https://tachyons.io/
[custom App]: https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app

### 2.2. Theme

Moai comes with both light and dark themes out of the box. However, there is no
default, so you must explicitly set a class on your `html` tag to specify the
theme: either `light` or `dark`.

- To avoid a [FOUC], ensure that your `html` tag has the class in the initial
render. This is usually done via a "template" file. In CRA, for example, set it
in [`public/index.html`].
- In Next.js, we recommend the [`next-themes`] package. It allows your users
to change the theme, including a "system" option, without any flashing in
initial render.

### 2.3. Font (Optional)

Out of the box, Moai uses [system fonts]. For example, on a modern Mac OS, you
would see the [San Francisco] typeface. This requires no additional setup
and is the best solution performance-wise.

However, the for best visual result, we highly recommend the [Inter] typeface.
To use it, just import the following CSS at your app's root, and Moai will use
Inter instead:

```tsx
import "@moai/core/dist/font/remote.css";
```

- Moai uses the [variable] version of Inter. Check browser compatibility if you
need to support old browsers.
- If your app cannot make network requests, replace "remote" with "local" in the
path above to use a bundled version of Inter. This may require a [special
setup].
- It is NOT recommended to use the version on Google Fonts since it lost many
[OpenType features].

## 3. Use the components

After the setup, just import the components from the package to use. All
components are exported at the top level:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@moai/core";

export const Foo = (): JSX.Element => (
	<Button>Hello</Button>
);
```

- Moai is distributed with an [ES6 module] version. If you are using an
ES6-aware bundler (such as [Rollup] or [Webpack 2+]), your app won't contain
the whole Moai library but only the components that you used, which may
significantly reduce your app size.
